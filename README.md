# SML_project
Team Project in Statistical machine learning 


## Intro
All students collect 200 photos of their classes.

After training a model with CIFAR10, we test the model with a dataset we collected.


## Models
We use 5 models to train 

## Loss
1. CrossEntropyLoss
2. LabelSmoothing
3. ElasticLoss

## Ensemble
Finally, we train 5 models with cifar10

## Result
